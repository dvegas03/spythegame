# Spy, the game

Description:

Introducing Spy, the game designed for Slack, perfect for team bonding. Ever wondered if that coworker of yours might secretly be a spy? Or perhaps, the spy might be you? Dive in and discover!

The game participants are secretly assigned roles - most are locals, except one spy they have to reveal. In each round, players have to find the spy or insure their own safety using only their word as a weapon. At the end of each round, the votes will define one person to kill, and everyone must hope they've made the right choice.

Let the game begin, and may the spy be unveiled!
